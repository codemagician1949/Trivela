#
# Build and deploy the Trivela rewards and campaign contracts to a Stellar
# network (testnet by default), printing the resulting contract IDs and
# writing them to a frontend env file (and optionally a backend env file).
#
# Required env:
#   STELLAR_SOURCE      Stellar account/identity to fund and sign the deploy.
#
# Optional env:
#   STELLAR_NETWORK     Defaults to "testnet". Pass "mainnet" or a configured
#                       stellar CLI network alias to deploy elsewhere.
#   TRIVELA_ENV_OUT     Frontend env file path. Defaults to ".env.testnet".
#   TRIVELA_BACKEND_ENV Optional backend env file. When set, the script also
#                       writes REWARDS_CONTRACT_ID/CAMPAIGN_CONTRACT_ID there.
